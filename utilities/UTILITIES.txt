--- tool ---

tool is a basic executable compiled with the Makefile that goes through 
every node of an output MMSP binary grid data file and performs 
calculations on that data. Tool is used here to calculate simply the
total area of the grains, and could likewise be extended to caclulate 
the total volume. Tool is also used here to generate a visualization 
of the data directly to png by mapping its grain boundaries.

Use for tool is:

./tool file.15000.dat output_directory/

which will execute tool on the output from file step number 15000 and 
output the resulting data files to the output_directory/. These output
fiels will be a .png grain boundary tracing and a .csv list of areas.
